This project was to refactor the code for a website for Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc. The website offers some descriptions on Search Engine Optimization, Social Media Marketing, Online Reputation Management, Brand Awareness, Cost Management, and Brand Awareness in relation to web marketing. The issues I found with the site thatI fixed were a missing title, a broken link, missing alt tags and descriptions, and consolidating some CSS selectors. Here is a picture of the finished site.
